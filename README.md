# djangobase
A starter project to bootstrap development with Docker and Django.

This project is not intended to be used as-is, but rather as a starter seed to grow 
your own project from.

## Getting Started
To begin, ensure that you already have Docker Engine installed and configured.  
Please see [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for more information on how 
to do that.

Also install Docker Compose using the 'pip' method described at 
[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
to enable the rest of our deployment and development capability.

Next, clone this project to your development system and name it somethnig relevant to
your sitename, like so:

`git clone git@github.com:growlf/djangobase.git mysite`
